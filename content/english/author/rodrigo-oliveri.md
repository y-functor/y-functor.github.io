#### Director at y-functor

I'm a senior software engineer with a bachelor's degree in CS and a decade of experience working in the industry. I wore multiple hats, from data warehousing and automation to full-stack web development, and grown both the technical skills needed for my roles and the soft ones. I was involved in challenging and rapidly changing problems that require flexibility, fast learning, problem-solving and effective communication in many different areas.

I have skills and worked with various languages, including Javascript, Python, Ruby, C#, and Java, but I love writing F# and Elixir (or any functional language for that matter).

I consider myself more a Jack-Of-All-Trades than a Specialist; I know it's not the most marketing thing to say, but I think it suits me best, and the people I worked for and with think the same.
